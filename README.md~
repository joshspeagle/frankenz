# Photoz-tools

This is a set of useful python notebooks related to photometric surveys and redshift estimation from noisy flux measurements.

Content:
- *BPZ_survey_mock.ipynb*: notebook to generate a photometric survey mock, with realistic fluxes, redshifts and underlying galaxy types, based on [BPZ](http://www.stsci.edu/~dcoe/BPZ/), which is required.
- *filters* and *seds* contain copies of the CWW galaxy SED templates and the SDSS photometric filters.

- Boris Leistedt (NYU)
- Daniel Mortlock (Imperial College)
