FILTER files (e.g., irac_ch1.res) should be in a two-column format
[wavelength (angstroms), transmissivity (0 to 1)] separated by a space and
ideally be stored in relevant subdirectories corresponding to the 
instrument and/or survey.

LIST files (e.g. COSMOS.list) should be in a four-column format
[counter (arbitrary), shorthand name (arbitrary), filename (local path),
5-sigma depths (AB magnitude)] separated by a space.

See http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~capak/filters/index.html for more
information on the filters.
